The `grad` parameter is a matrix of partial derivatives of the loss, with respect to the data sent from the given layer to the next. As such, it is a `(batch_sz, out)` matrix. The job of `bp_input` is to return a `(batch_sz, in)` matrix to be sent to the next layer by multiplying `grad` by the derivative of the forward pass with respect to the _input_ (or an equivalent operation).\n",

    "- **`bp_param(self, grad)`**: the \"final stop\" of the backwards pass. Only applicable for layers with trainable weights. Similar to `bp_input`, but calculates the derivative with respect to the _weights_ of the layer. Should return a matrix with the same shape as the weights (`self.W`) to be updated."

    "2. I won't prove it here, but it turns out that the derivative of the loss with respect to the input to the softmax, is much simpler than the two intermediate derivative operations, and bypasses the numerical stability issues that arise when we do the exponential and the logarithm. Phew!\n",
    "\n",
    "The downside here is that is we're just doing _inference_ then we only want the softmax output. But for the purposes of this tutorial we only really care about training. So this will do just fine!\n",
    "\n",
    "There's a trick in the second line of the softmax implementation: it turns out subtracting the argmax from the softmax input keeps the output the same, but the intermediate values are more numerically stable. How neat!\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we examine the backprop step. It's so simple! Our starting grad for backprop (the initial `grad` value passed in is just the ones vector) is the difference in our predicted output vector and the actual one-hot encoded label. This is so intuitive and wonderful.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Tip: This is exactly the same derivative as when we don't use a softmax layer and apply an MSE loss (i.e. the regression case). We can thus think of softmax + cross entropy as a way of getting to the same underlying backprop, but in the classification case."
