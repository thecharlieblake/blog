As of October 2020, I've just finished my MSc in Computer Science at Oxford
University, and am looking to work in Data Science / Machine Learning
Engineering. I did my undergraduate degree at the University of St Andrews. My
interests include Deep Learning, Reinforcement Learning, Graph Neural Networks
and Solitaire card games.
