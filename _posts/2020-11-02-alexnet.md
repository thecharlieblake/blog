## Introduction

- Convnets already introduced
- Massively outperforms previous models
- etc

## The Dataset

- Imagenet much larger than previous datasets

- ...

  ImageNet is a dataset of over 15 million labeled high-resolution images belonging to roughly 22,000categories.  The images were collected from the web and labeled by human labelers using Ama-zonâ€™s Mechanical Turk crowd-sourcing tool.
