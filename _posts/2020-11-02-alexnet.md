## Abstract

> We trained a large, deep convolutional neural network to classify the  1.2 million high-resolution images in the ImageNet LSVRC-2010 contest  into the 1000 different classes. On the test data, we achieved top-1 and top-5 error rates of 37.5% and 17.0%, respectively, which is  considerably better than the previous state-of-the-art. The neural  network, which has 60 million parameters and 650,000 neurons, consists  of five convolutional layers, some of which are followed by max-pooling  layers, and three fully connected layers with a final 1000-way softmax.  To make training faster, we used non-saturating neurons and a very  efficient GPU implementation of the convolution operation. To reduce  overfitting in the fully connected layers we employed a recently  developed regularization method called "dropout" that proved to be very  effective. We also entered a variant of this model in the ILSVRC-2012  competition and achieved a winning top-5 test error rate of 15.3%,  compared to 26.2% achieved by the second-best entry.
